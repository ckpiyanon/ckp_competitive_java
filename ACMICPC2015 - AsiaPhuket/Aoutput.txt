Oct. 2, 2015. A historic NASA spacecraft makes more than just a cameo appearance in
"The Martian," the new Ridley Scott movie about an astronaut stranded on Mars.
The 20th Century Fox film, which opened in U.S. theaters on Friday (Oct. 2),
follows NASA's third crewed mission to land on the Red Planet in 2035.
By the movie's timeline, Ares 3 crew member Mark Watney (Matt Damon) walks on 
Mars 23 years after the space agency's most recent real-life "martian," the robotic rover
Curiosity, arrived to search for environments habitable to supporting past and present life.
But it's not Curiosity that is in "The Martian." (Spoiler alert: the following contains plot
details from the movie.)
Rather, it is NASA's first Mars rover, and more specifically its three-petal lander,
that Watney uses to contact Earth.
Mars Pathfinder and its small, six-wheeled Sojourner rover touched down on Mars on
July 4, 1997. For almost three months, the lander beamed back billions of bits of data,
including tens of thousands of images, before it fell silent. The science gathered by
the lander and rover suggested that Mars was warm and wet in its past, a finding
that was confirmed by later NASA missions, including Curiosity.
